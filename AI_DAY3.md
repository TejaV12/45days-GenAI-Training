**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

AI is about building systems that can simulate human intelligence



**Types of AI:**

-->Narrow AI – task-specific systems (Chatbots, recommendation systems)

-->General AI – human-like intelligence (future scope)

-->Super AI – beyond human intelligence (theoretical)



**AI vs ML vs DL**

**>>AI:** Making machines intelligent

**>>Machine Learning:** Learning from data

**>>Deep Learning:** Neural networks inspired by the human brain



**Generative AI (GenAI):**

..AI systems that can generate text, images, and code

Foundation models like LLMs power modern AI tools



**Python Fundamentals:**

**-Functions:** Reusable blocks of code

**-Lists:** Mutable, used in real-time applications

**-Tuples:** Immutable, safer for fixed data



**APIs:**

..Application Programming Interfaces

How applications communicate with each other

Used heavily in real-time AI and web applications



**HTTP Methods:**

->GET – fetch data

->POST – send data

->PUT – update data

->DELETE – remove data



**Requests Library (Python)**

Used to interact with APIs

Makes real-time data fetching simple and efficient

Widely used in AI, automation, and backend integrations
