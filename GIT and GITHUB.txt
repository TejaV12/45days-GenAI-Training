Step to add file in Git and GitHub:

first open our file manger and in path enter CMD command
It will open command prompt then command the following comments:
>>>git init
>>>git add .
>>>git commit -m "any comment we can give"
Then it will show  
{[master (root-commit) 8b9fb98] My first commit
 1 file changed, 16 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html}

After this we have to open the GitHub account and create a new repository 
Then come to CMD now follow the comments:
>>>git remote add origin https://github.com/TejaV12/3-2.git 
>>>git branch {it will show the branch of our repository like master or main}
>>>git branch -M master
>>>git push -u origin master
The it will show 
     {Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 399 bytes | 99.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
To https://github.com/TejaV12/3-2.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
branch 'master' set up to track 'origin/master'.} 

After open the GitHub we can see the files in repository

Then open the settings in the same repository and in left side we can the pages 
Open the pages and there we have to save the our branch and it will refresh the page 
Then the we have to give any Domine name and save it 
It will show the visit site button there we can see the our web application in browser
